# Unit Testing

1. We should be able to use unit testing to, for example if you dont want your messaging app to have profanity words, limit words. You can use unit testing to cover those area

2. If it is testing max length. I would use it to test, by having the test pass when sendinng nothing but a black, and up to 80 characters of black spaces
